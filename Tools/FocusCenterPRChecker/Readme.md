# Introduction

The PR checker is a tool that automates some of the common checks when reviewing pull requests for Dynamics 365 solutions. Every development team reviews PR to check key attributes to ensure that the PR is adhering to their standards. Automating the PR governance process helps ensure deployment quality without requiring a manual review of basic checks such as solution versions. 


# Components and functionality

## Components

PR Checker Tool consist of four components:

1.  Tool's exe,
2.  Tool's app config,
3.  Pipeline variable group
4.  Command line script.

Users will see review comments from PR checker tool on their respective PRs.

## Functionality

The PR checker currently has the following features:

1.  **Check duplicate components**: Checks if a component is present across multiple solutions in the repo. This way a particular component is not customized in multiple solutions by mistake. It will also ensure clear ownership of components in a solution and prevent overwriting of customizations in Test/Prod environments.

2.  **Check duplicate connection references**: Check if any connection references is present across multiple solutions in the repo. This prevents confusion on higher environments when the connection reference is setup with an unexpected for one of the solutions using this connection reference.

4.  **Check lastupdated process field**: This is a custom field that needs to contain the flow name in Dataverse Create/Update actions. This check was built when multiple flows were updating the same tables/records. This allows users to look into the audit history of a record to determine the flows that operated one it.

    a.  **Flow auditing attribute**: The name of the attribute which would be traced in all the Dataverse Create/Update actions of flow. This attribute is needed for record auditing purposes in the Environment.

5.  **Check missing connection references**: Checks if any connection references are missing in the solution in the repo but are referenced in flows. This prevents solution import failures into higher environment when flows refer to a brand-new connection reference that is not part of the solution.

6.  **Check publisher**: This rule ensures publisher values are consistent in the org. The configurable values are provided in solutionpublisherprefix, solutionpublisheruniquename, solutionpublisheroptionvalueprefix variables. This enforces consistency of solution information across apps in an environment.

7.  **Check security roles**: This rule logs role permissions in the PR as comments in an easy-to-read tabular format. 

9.  **Check solution version**: Check if solution version is incremented compared to the solution version from the master branch.

11. **Enable comments to pull request**: Set this flag true to post comments to PR else comments will be added to only console.

12. **Exclusion list path**: If a certain list of components, entities, folders, file extensions need to be excluded by the tool, then they should be added here.

13. **Solution publisher option value prefix**: This is comma separated string (without space) mentioning all allowed option value prefix.

14. **Solution publisher prefix**: Comma separated string (without space) mentioning all allowed publisher prefix.

15. **Solution publisher unique name**: Comma separated string (without space) mentioning all allowed publisher unique prefix.

# Pre-requisites

-   Create/Get personal access token (PAT) which will be used to authenticate into Azure DevOps. For more information, see [Personal access tokens (PAT)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops).
-   URL of organization in Azure DevOps.
-   For code searches that are invoked in PR checker,Â install **Code Search** **Extension** ([Code Search](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-code-search)) from Marketplace extension. It is required for the PR checker to be executed without exceptions. For more information, see [Functional code search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/search/functional-code-search?view=azure-devops).

# Setup

PR Checker Tool is an application, for which the executable can be added to the repository and configured as mentioned in the sections below. To generate the executables, clone the repo and build the FocusCenterPRChecker project. The following files will be generated in the project's bin folder. 

-   ExclusionList.xml (DuplicatesComponentTool folder)
-   FocusCenterPRChecker.exe
-   FocusCenterPRChecker.exe.config
-   FocusCenterPRChecker.pdb
-   Newtonsoft.Json.dll

They need to be added to your repository for PR Checker to work (see screenshot below):

6. Create another variable group say "FocusCenter- PR Tool PAT" and enable "**Link secrets from an Azure key vault**". For more information, see [Link secrets from an Azure key vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#link-secrets-from-an-azure-key-vault). Storing PAT token in the Key Vault is recommended, but not required. You can use secured variable in variable group as an alternative.

  |  Variable Name      | Description | Values & Example |
  | ------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
  | PAT-shplat          | PAT Token   |                  |

  PAT Token should have at least the permissions below for PR Checker to execute successfully.
  - Work Items - **Read**
  - Project and Team - **Read**
  - Member Entitlement Management - **Read**
  - Code - **Read & Write**

*Note: If any of above values are not set then tool will show below error.*

2.  #### Configure tool in pipeline

    1.  Use the variable groups created in *Pre-requisites Section*. Open your pipeline and select **Variables \> Variable groups**, and then choose **Link variable group**. Select the previous created groups.

    2.  In pipeline, add *command line* task (Run a command line script using Bash on Linux and macOS and cmd.exe on Windows).

    3.  Add *Display name.*

    4.  In the *Script* section, add:
    
        ```.\\FocusCenterPRChecker.exe ..\..\..\Extracted $(PAT-shplat) $(System.PullRequest.PullRequestId)```

        a.  Exe name

        b.  Relative path to solution repository

        c.  PAT variable name from pipeline variables

        d.  PullRequestId from internal system variables that are available in each pipeline.

        *Note: Add the above values separated by space.*

    5. Click on *Advanced* and add Path to exe in *Working Directory.*
